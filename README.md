# Data-science-exercises
Repository Structure
The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each topic covered in the course. Each folder contains:

Exercises: Practical coding exercises designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in the course. These exercises range from basic implementations to more complex problems that require you to apply the knowledge you've gained.
Datasets: Real-world datasets that you will use to perform the exercises and practice the techniques learned. Each dataset is accompanied by a description and the questions/tasks you need to complete.
